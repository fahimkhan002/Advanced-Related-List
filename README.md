  - equals
  - not equal to
  - contains
  - does not contain
  - starts with
  - ends with
  - less than
  - greater than

Example of filter configuration:
```javascript
[
    {
        field: "LastName",
        operator: "STARTS",
        value: "Smith",
        logicOperator: "AND"
    },
    {
        field: "Email",
        operator: "CONTAINS",
        value: "@example.com",
        logicOperator: "OR"
    }
]
```

### Enhanced Security
The component implements comprehensive security measures:
- Object-level CRUD permission checks
- Field-level security enforcement
- Validation of all user inputs
- Secure query building with proper escaping
- Permission-based action visibility
- Custom error messaging for permission issues

### Address Field Handling
Improved handling of compound address fields:
- Support for all standard address fields (Mailing, Shipping, Billing, Other)
- Automatic component separation and formatting
- Proper search functionality across address components
- Responsive display formatting

## Usage Examples
